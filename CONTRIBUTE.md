### 1. Adding a benchmark case

Each benchmark case should follow the existing folder structure.

Include a `README.md` with these sections:

* **Summary** – problem description.
* **Domain and meshes** – description and parameterisation (if applicable).
* **Model problem** – governing equations and parameters
* **Analytical/manufactured solution** – source terms, boundary conditions, and analytical parameters.
* **Case parameters** – user-defined parameters and suggested values.
* **Scripts and files** – description, usage (if applicable), requirements, and dependencies.
* **How to cite** – references where the benchmark case was originally published.

Organise your files in these folders:

* `codes/`
* `images/`
* `meshes/`
* `scripts/`

Follow these style guidelines:

* Use **Markdown** for documentation.
* Use descriptive and consistent **variable and function naming**.
* Keep code clean, organised, and well-commented.
* Maintain compatibility with existing scripts whenever possible.

### 2. Refinement of scripts/enhancement of documentation
